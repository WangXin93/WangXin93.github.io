[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

> The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical prodigy at age 4, took 13 more years before he began to produce world-class music.

So You Want to be a Programmer?

* Get interested in programming. Keep being enough fun so that your will be willing to put in your ten years.
* Program. The best kind of learning is **learning by doing**.
* Talk with other programmers, read other programs. This is more important than any book or training course.
* Take time (four years of college?) to dive into one field.
* Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer on some projects; be the worst on some others. When your are the best, you get to test your abilities to lead a project and inspire others with your vision. When you are the worst, you learn what the masters do, and you learn what they don't like to do.
* Work on projects after other programmers. Understand a program written by someone else.  See what it takes to understand and fix it when the original programmers are not around. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for those who will maintain them after you.
* Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes paralleism (like Clojure or Go).
* Get involved in a language **standardization** effort, like ANSI C++ committee. But remember to have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible.
